Hiiii! I'm Frost, a Pony!

I play Pony Town from time to time (recently a bit too much). I'm mainly
fascinated with its design and inner goings.


If you spot me on PT ask me to draw your pony! (If I have time (which
barely happens) and I like how your pony looks I might do it!)

If you have any projects you want to collab on, I'd be happy to
hear you out!
